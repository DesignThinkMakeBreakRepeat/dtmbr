Co-design workshops bring users, customers, stakeholders and designers together to rapidly and iteratively critique design concepts, ensuring that the needs of the people we are designing for remain at the centre of the design process. Co- design and similar methodologies, such as participatory design, invite users and other stakeholders to build on concepts they are presented with (be it a current user experience or a new design concept) and inform the future direction of the design. The principle of co-design is to ‘design with’ rather than ‘designing for’ people. Users and other stakeholders are in an active role, contributing to the design, rather than passively responding to design decisions.
