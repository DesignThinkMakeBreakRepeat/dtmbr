We live in a complex networked world, and this is reflected in the nature of the problems we face. Each problem fits in a larger system, and it is important to acknowledge this. A systems map visually represents the components of this larger system and helps us to understand its causal relationships. Systems maps support systems thinking, which is an approach to understanding how the individual components within a network influence each other.
