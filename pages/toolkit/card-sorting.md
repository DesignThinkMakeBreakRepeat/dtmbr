From newspapers to websites and microwave ovens to mobile apps, on a daily basis the average person encounters and navigates a huge amount of information in the form of text, icons, images and numbers. Whether in the interface of a simple alarm clock or the workings of a large complex multi-user system, the way information is labelled, grouped and structured shapes how a product or service is used. Designers often refer to this structuring of content as a product’s information architecture. This is most clearly seen in website design, where navigation, tabs and pages create hierarchies and groups that order what the user sees.
