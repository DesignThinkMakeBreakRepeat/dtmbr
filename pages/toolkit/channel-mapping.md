Channel mapping is a method that explores what a company’s brand values mean to a particular customer. It does this by going beyond listing the ways in which customers are contacted by that company. Companies engage with their customers through a range of channels. Every interaction that people have with a company involves some form of channel. Channels can be digital (e.g. websites) or physical (e.g. stores). They represent routes of communication between an organisation and its customers, which includes completing commercial transactions. In particular, online purchases are one of the most rapidly growing forms of shopping, with the growth rate of online sales outperforming buying through traditional retail channels.
