Ethnographic research entails the use of qualitative methods for collecting data about a target audience. Traditional ethnography involves the researcher becoming part of a community and collecting field data through observations and interactions, overtly or covertly. The strength of conducting an ethnographic study lies in the richness of the data collected, which can deliver insights that would not be possible to gather through other methods alone, such as interviews (p.92).
