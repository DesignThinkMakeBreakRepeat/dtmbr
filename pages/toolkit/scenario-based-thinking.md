When we design for a future that doesn’t exist yet, it can be useful to start the process by understanding what potential future scenarios might look like. Exploring multiple, rather than just one, future scenarios offers a number of opportunities for design. It assists us with deciding which design decisions to make now in order to: move towards a preferred future; help us gain inspiration for new speculative design interventions; and guide us towards design decisions that make sense in a variety of plausible futures. It’s a powerful method, as it allows a team or business to strategically adapt their actions with a long-term view in mind.
