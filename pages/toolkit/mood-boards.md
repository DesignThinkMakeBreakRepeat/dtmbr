Mood boards are used to visually represent design ideas, concepts and values in an open-ended and evocative way. There are no specific formulas for designing mood boards. However, they should be crafted to foster discussion and to facilitate the generation of ideas. The final outcome looks similar to a collage, comprising images from magazines, photographs and other visual elements, such as coloured paper, textures, fabrics and any other object that could be easily attached to a blank surface or board. It is also possible to create digital mood boards, which may include video snippets, website captures, various images and so on.
