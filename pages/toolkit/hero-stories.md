The hero stories method involves the creation and evaluation of speculative stories around key experiences that people might have with an envisioned product or service. Typically, a hero story focuses on a single user’s experience, for example, based on a previously developed persona (p.122). Different to persona-based walkthroughs (p.120), which focus on common tasks or scenarios, hero stories explore extreme scenarios.
