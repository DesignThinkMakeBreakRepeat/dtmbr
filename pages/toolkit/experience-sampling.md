The experience sampling method (ESM) allows collecting real-time self-reporting data about subjective experiences, such as mental state, emotions or thoughts. The method captures such experiences by asking respondents to stop at predetermined times to report on their state or how they are feeling. The time of reporting is either predetermined based on events or signalled, for example, using mobile phone text messages, at which point the respondent will stop what they are doing and answer a questionnaire or report their experience in a diary.
