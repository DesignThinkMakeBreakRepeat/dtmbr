Many research methods focus on isolating and answering specific questions. But products and services themselves are never used in isolation; they are embedded in our messy, complex lives (Sanders & Stappers, 2012). Every time we interact with a design there are diverse forces at play – the place, the time and our state of mind. Past experiences and future aspirations also influence how we behave and respond. Design research is most valuable when we are able to capture this context realistically – messiness and all.
