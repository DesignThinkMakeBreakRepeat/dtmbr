Empathy is the ability to understand the experience of others. Being immersed in someone’s experience, or putting yourself in someone else’s shoes, is a critical skill for designers to understand the perceived and actual challenges that a user faces. However, experiences are subjective, and it can be difficult to ‘feel’ or ‘understand’ the experiences of others.
