The purpose of design research is to gain valuable insights through data. By analysing and synthesising this data, we are able to derive information that confirms, informs and inspires. These insights help us move forward with a design project with confidence that we understand our users’ needs. It’s important to capture research insights in a way that is easy for everyone to understand. Often this is done through generating a research report. However, it can be difficult to quickly gain an overview of the design research findings from a lengthy report.
