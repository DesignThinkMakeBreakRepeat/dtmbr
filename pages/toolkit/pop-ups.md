Pop-up installations provide an alternative way for collecting data during the research phase, particularly in design projects that cater for a broad demographic. They can be used to engage with people in public spaces by employing a variety of formats, such as ‘pop-up’ events (e.g. pop-up bars, pop-up shops, pop-up markets) that are located in high pedestrian thoroughfares and create fun and interactive environments. Originally used in community engagement, pop-ups can activate public spaces, create curiosity and encourage people within a particular space to interact. As such, they are especially well- suited for collecting data ‘in context’.
