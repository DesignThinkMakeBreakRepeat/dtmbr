Interviews are one of the most flexible research tools available to designers. They can be used in many phases of the design process to gather information from experts, users and other stakeholders. The aim of an interview may be to discern background information about a problem area, gauge users’ opinions about concepts or collect detailed feedback about a new prototype. With well-crafted interviews we can gain deep insight into the experiences of users and develop empathy with the people we are designing for. Interviews are particularly useful for gathering concrete information about existing experiences rather than speculation about future products or situations.
