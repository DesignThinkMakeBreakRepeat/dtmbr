Workshops, one of the fundamental methods of participatory design, bring together a group of people to solve
a problem, consisting of designers, researchers, users, clients and other stakeholders sharing a common interest. Workshops foster empowerment, democracy, teamwork, and collective thinking and making. Designers usually work as a facilitator in workshops. The future workshops method allows us to identify the problems related to a current situation, imagine alternative solutions and outline an action plan for implementing these solutions. It is a structured workshop with three phases: critique, fantasy and implementation.
