The laddering method is an interview technique used to discover the underlying reasons for people’s views about a product or service. Most people can easily articulate what they do or don’t like about a product or service regarding its basic attributes. However, it is more difficult to identify the reasons; how the direct consequences of these attributes affect them and how this relates to their values. This is what the framework of the laddering method offers.
