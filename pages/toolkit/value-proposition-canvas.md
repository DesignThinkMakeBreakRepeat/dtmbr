Designing products and services that offer pleasurable experiences can provide a strategic advantage and help solutions to stand out in a competitive landscape. For example, when ride-hailing company Uber entered the market, it offered passengers a more pleasurable experience compared to that of the often unreliable taxi services. Uber managed to resolve many of the pain points existing with taxi services at the time while providing an overall better experience to passengers, such as real-time tracking of vehicles and mobile payment of ride fees.
