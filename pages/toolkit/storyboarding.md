Storyboards in design are used to visually explore the interactions between people and products or services. They can either represent an existing situation or communicate an envisioned situation. When depicting existing situations, the story should be based on real data, for example, collected through contextual observation (p.50). Storyboards of existing situations are effective for highlighting issues with current experiences. Storyboards of envisioned situations can be used for evaluating early concepts with other team members or prospective users and for communicating concepts to others.
