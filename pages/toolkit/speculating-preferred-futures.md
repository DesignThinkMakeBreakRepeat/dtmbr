Imagining a future that is different to the present can be challenging. In order to imagine new realities, we have to think beyond our current knowledge. To do this, it’s important to suspend belief and creatively envision alternative responses to challenging contexts. It’s also important to recognise that not all concepts, ideas and interventions will have a positive effect. We need to be aware of the potential implications or unintended impacts our designs might have.
