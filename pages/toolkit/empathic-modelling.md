When designing products or services, it is critical to ensure that they are accessible to all users. Empathic modelling is a method that prompts us to think beyond designing for an ideal user of an ideal height with ideal eyesight and ideal motor skills. It is used to simulate, from a first person perspective, some of the everyday challenges people with reduced physical or perceptual abilities experience. This allows designers to develop an empathic connection and use other people’s experiences to inform the design of products or services.
