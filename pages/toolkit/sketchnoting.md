Sketchnotes are visual notes that are a popular technique for capturing the content of a public talk or panel discussion through an illustration combining sketches and annotations. In design, sketchnotes are used to capture a current process, make a plan, visualise a design idea or communicate within the design team and to stakeholders. Similar to sketching (p.142), sketchnoting can also be used for ideation. Creating a visual note of an idea for a concept allows for reflection on the specifics, values and implications of the concept. Compared to other methods, this has the advantage of being able to use visual cues to access tacit aspects of an idea without sacrificing detailed content.
