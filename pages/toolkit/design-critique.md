The value of the design critique method is three-fold. First, it yields valuable feedback quickly, regularly and at low cost without having to involve participants from the target audience, as is the case, for example, in usability testing (p.160). Second, it allows people to develop their skills in providing constructive feedback and in doing so to improve their own design knowledge. Third, it builds resilience in the designer to be open to criticism of their work, and thus improve its quality.
