For more than a century, artists, architects and photographers have been concerned with the pursuit of recording the bodily movements of humans through space and time. Before video cameras they had to make do with static means. This fascination with how to capture motion over time led to the Italian art movements of dynamism and futurism, which upheld the ideals of capturing energy on the canvas or in sculptural form.
