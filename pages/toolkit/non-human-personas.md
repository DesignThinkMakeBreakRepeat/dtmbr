When designing products, services and systems, we tend to turn to methods that put humans at the centre of our design process. This is important to ensure that our design interventions address the needs of the end users, customers and other stakeholders. However, there is an increasing awareness that focusing solely on human needs and values may be detrimental to the planet and humanityâ€™s continued existence. Non-human personas address this limitation of human-centred methods, by adapting the personas (p.122) method to give non-human stakeholders a voice in the design process.
