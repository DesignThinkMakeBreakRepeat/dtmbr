Brainwriting 6-3-5 is a form of brainstorming that was developed as a way of getting around the group dynamic issues that can plague conventional brainstorms (Rohrbach, 1969). For example, shy people do not contribute as much as they have to offer, strong personalities dominate the conversation and existing power relationships (e.g. between employees and managers) can influence the ideation process. Brainwriting 6-3-5 overcomes these issues by combining individual and collaborative ideation. Like brainstorming, it aims to stimulate creativity in the early phases of a design process.
