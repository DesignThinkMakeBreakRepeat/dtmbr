Mapping, and other methods involving making collages, are frequently employed in participatory design workshops to capture and understand domain specific user knowledge. Cartographic mapping is a mapping method with a particular focus on the mediating role of the mapmaking activity in mutual knowledge construction. In this method, the facilitator and participant work together to create a visualisation of the participant’s daily routines, relationships and settings within a problem domain.
