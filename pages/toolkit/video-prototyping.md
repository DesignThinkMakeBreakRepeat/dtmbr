Video prototyping is a useful method to communicate an idea before building functional prototypes. A video prototype is a short movie showing how one or more users would interact with a future product based on a scenario (p.136) (Markopoulos, 2016). This allows rapid recording of concepts in an engaging visually rich format. Using videos is beneficial for providing the context of use, communicating a narrative around experiencing a product or service and showing interactions between people and their environment including facial expressions and body gestures.
