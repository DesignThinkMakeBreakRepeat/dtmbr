Mind mapping is a notetaking and notemaking technique that developed in the 1970s, emerging from cognitive research about how our brains interpret and store information. In mind mapping we record information in a way that utilises physical and spatial relations to better facilitate long-term retention. The technique has several applications in design, as we are often dealing with large amounts of information which makes it difficult to retain an overview.
