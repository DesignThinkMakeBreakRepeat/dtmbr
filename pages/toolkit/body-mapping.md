Our bodies are an important source of information about how we experience the world and ourselves. Paying attention to internal sensations and feelings can give us insight into how we are affected by our external interactions with the world around us. However, our emotions and feelings are not static but complex and changing over time. It can be difficult to describe and document our bodily experience through words. In these situations, visual documentation offers an alternative means of expressing tacit knowledge through images, colour, line, shape and texture.
