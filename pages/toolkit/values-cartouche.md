Our values are fundamental to who we are and guide many of our day-to-day decisions. These value systems are shaped by a number of factors including personal, social, political and cultural experiences and perspectives. Despite the large influence they have on our lives, it can be difficult for us to articulate these individual values and to understand how they influence our decision-making processes. Values cartouches can be used to support individuals to identify and reflect upon their own values as well as creating an opportunity to explore the underlying factors that influence, inform and support decision-making.
