When we embark on a design project, we usually want to solve a specific challenge or come up with an innovative new idea within a problem area. It is easy but dangerous to get stuck on the first solution that comes to mind. Reframing is a way of learning to look at a problem from a different perspective in order to unlock a broader range of potential solutions.
