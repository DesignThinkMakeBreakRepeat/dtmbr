Wireflow diagrams are a quick way to visualise how individual screen designs ‘connect’ to each other. The wireflow method uses elements from wireframes (p.174) (used in interface design to show the layout of static content and dynamic interaction elements) and flowcharts (used by system engineers to visually communicate how a piece of software works). A wireflow brings both of these communication tools together. This allows interface designers to think beyond the layout of an individual screen design and to consider the relationship between screens and the user journey and how these will affect the overall experience. Developing wireflows helps designers spot issues with their design quickly before development starts.
