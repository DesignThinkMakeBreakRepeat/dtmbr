The group passing technique – also referred to as ‘brainsketching’ – is a form of brainstorming that engages a team of people in collaboratively producing new ideas, solutions or design concepts. By working together, the team can draw on each other’s creative inputs. The technique seeks new perspectives on each idea from all members of the team, encouraging them to contribute to an idea while avoiding criticism or negative feedback.
