Bodystorming is a form of brainstorming, with an emphasis on generating ideas and unexpected insights through physical exploration, experience and interaction. While brainstorming is typically done with pen and paper sitting down, bodystorming requires active physical participation. Using our whole bodies to act out situations enables us to draw inspiration from the way in which our senses respond to the world, not just how we think about it.
