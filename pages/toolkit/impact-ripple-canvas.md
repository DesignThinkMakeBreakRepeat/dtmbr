Everything we design has consequences, large or small, intended or unintended. Just like a drop of rainwater in a pond or an asteroid hitting the surface of the Moon, everything we design creates ripples in the world. It is not easy to think about the far-reaching impacts of what we create, as our brains are wired to imagine only the most immediate effects of an action; anything beyond that becomes difficult to comprehend. The impact ripple canvas helps designers (and non-designers) to visualise and think about the impacts of their work in a multi-level and networked way.
