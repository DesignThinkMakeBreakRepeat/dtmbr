Whenever we take part in a service, we only see the part that is happening ‘on stage’. Entering a cafe, we might choose a muffin, pay the cashier and enjoy our food while reading the paper. But even a service as simple as this consists of both visible and invisible components. Much needs to happen ‘backstage’ – muffins get baked and delivered, the electronic payment system transmits payment information and the cafe gets stocked with newspapers each day.
