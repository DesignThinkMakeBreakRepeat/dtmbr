The handbook introduces the reader to the changing role of design as a way of thinking and a framework for solving complex problems and achieving systemic change. It documents 80 methods that cover all stages of a design process, providing actionable guidance for applying the methods across a range of projects.

The methods are complemented by seven case studies to demonstrate their application in different domains, from designing interfaces for autonomous vehicles to addressing health and wellbeing.

Free templates and resources available from this website make this a great resource for design educators as well as practitioners leading workshops in their organisation or looking for inspiration to transform their practice.

The first edition of the book was published in 2018 and included 60 methods. The revised edition, published in 2021, documents 20 additional methods, new case studies and a new chapter on life-centred design.
