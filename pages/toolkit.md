You can find free resources for the 80 methods included in our book below. Resources include printable templates, materials for running design exercises and slides for using the methods in a class or workshop setting.

To learn more about each of the methods and for a step-by-step guide for how to use the methods, you will need a copy of the book. If you already know how to use the methods and are just here for a free template, thatâ€™s totally OK too!
