# Digital edition

 The book is also available as an eBook [via Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Think-Make-Break-Repeat/dp/9063695853/). Because of the double-page layout design, the digital edition is best viewed on an eBook reader like Apple Books or Kindle Cloud Reader. Some of the formatting is lost when viewed on eBook reading devices.

The first edition of Design. Think. Make. Break. Repeat. has been translated into Russian, available in local bookstores and online stores.
