Redesigned (2023) companion website to the book Design Think Make Break Repeat.

This website is built using Jekyll and published on GitHub Pages. Commits to the `main` branch will cause the website to be rebuilt.

Most content on the home page is stored in `_data/site-parts.yaml`.

Method pages are stored in `pages/toolkit` and expect a banner image 800px by 300px with the same basename. Method templates and other attachements should be saved to `resources/`.
